   This document obsoletes RFC8007. The document describes the part of Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) Control interface that allows a CDN to trigger
   activity in an interconnected CDN that is configured to deliver
   content on its behalf. The upstream CDN MAY use this mechanism to
   request that the downstream CDN pre-position metadata or content as well as 
   request that it invalidate or purge metadata or content. The
   upstream CDN MAY monitor the status of activity that it has triggered
   in the downstream CDN.</t>

   <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction"><t>
   <xref target="RFC6707"/> introduces the problem scope for Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) and lists the four categories of interfaces
   that may be used to compose a CDNI solution (Control, Metadata,
   Request Routing, and Logging).</t>

   <t>
   <xref target="RFC7336"/> expands on the information provided in <xref target="RFC6707"/> and
   describes each of the interfaces and the relationships between them
   in more detail.</t>

   <t>
   The CDNI Control Interface / Triggers 1st edition <xref target="RFC8007"/>, deprecated by this document, describes the "CI/T" interface -- "CDNI Control interface / Triggers". It does not consider those parts of the
   Control interface that relate to configuration, bootstrapping, or
   authentication of CDN Interconnect interfaces. Section 4 of
   <xref target="RFC7337"/> identifies the requirements specific to the CI/T interface;
   requirements applicable to the CI/T interface are CI-1 to CI-6.</t>
   
   <t>
           This document is a second edition of the CDNI Control Interface / Triggers, 
	   which defines a new version, "v2", of the interface objects. 
	   The new objects replace the trigger interface's main objects, the "ci-trigger-command" object and its matching
	   "ci-trigger-status" object with "ci-trigger" object to support <xref target="REST">REST</xref> architectural style 
	   in a way that improves the interface's flexibility, extensibility and interoperability, and allows encoding the 
	   interface using OpenAPI.  
	   The document also provides a Trigger Extension mechanism that MAY be used to provide further instruction
	   on the trigger execution.

   </t>
   <t>
           This second edition also includes cascaded CDN error propagation and extended trigger status reporting for improved
           trigger execution monitoring, as well as use of external object lists for improved scale and integraion of
           trigger-based APIs with existing content workflows.

   <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology"><t>
   This document reuses the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC6707"/> and uses
   "uCDN" and "dCDN" as shorthand for "upstream CDN" and "downstream CDN", respectively.</t>

   <t>Additionally, the following terms are used throughout this document
      and are defined as follows:</t>

      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as

   <section title="Model for CDNI Triggers" anchor="model-for-cdni-triggers">
   <section title="REST Architecture" anchor="model-for-cdni-triggers-rest">

	<t>
	The CI/T interface utilizwes HTTP/1.1 protocol <xref target="RFC9112"/> and follows the principles 
	of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.
	uCDN, in its capacity of a CI/T interface client, makes a request to dCDN to carry out an action ("trigger")
	related to metadata or content stored by dCDN on behalf of uCDN.  
	</t>
	<t>The CI/T interface supports the following types of action::</t>

	<t>
		<list style="symbols">
		<t>preposition - used to instruct dCDN to fetch metadata from the uCDN or content from any origin including uCDN.</t>
   		<t>invalidate - used to instruct dCDN to revalidate specific metadata or content before reusing it.</t>
		<t>purge - used to instruct dCDN to delete specific metadata or content.</t>
   		</list>
   	</t>
   	<t> Note that additional action types can be defined and registered in the future. </t>

	<t>
	dCDN, as a CI/T interface server,  governs the triggers as a set of resources, which can be dynamically created 
	and deleted, and whose state can be retrieved and/or modified by uCDN.  
	Each such trigger is identified by a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
	is defined in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC9110"/>.
	</t>

	<t>
	Once a trigger is created, uCDN can retrieve its trigger state from dCDN or request its state to be modified by 
	transferring trigger representation to dCDN.
	The CI/T interface supports representation of trigger resources using JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/>.
	</t>

   </section>

   <section title="HTTP Methods" anchor="model-for-cdni-triggers-http-methods">
	<t>
	Section 9.3 of <xref target="RFC9110"/> defines the set of methods in HTTP. 
	The CI/T interface uses some of these methods for resource creation, retrieval of resource state, modification 
	of resources and deletion of resources. 
	The HTTP methods not listed here are not supported by the CI/T interface.
	</t>

	<list style="symbols">
		<t>
			GET - used to retrieve current state of a resource. 
			The GET method doesn't cause any state change on the server side.
		</t>
		<t>
			POST - used to request that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request.
			If a resource has been created on the server as a result of successfully processing a POST request, 
			the server sends a 201 (Created) response containing a Location header field that contains an identifier
			for the newly created resource
		</t>
		<t>	
			DELETE - used to request the server remove the target resource. 
		</t>
		<t>	
			HEAD - used to request metadata associated with the target resource, in the form of HTTP response 
			headers that would have been sent if the GET method was used instead. The HEAD method can be used to 
			verify that the target resource exists at the server.
		</t>
	</list>
   </section>

   <section title="Trigger Resource" anchor="model-for-cdni-triggers-trigger">
	<t>
		To request that an action be carried by dCDN, uCDN requests to create a trigger resource. 
		If dCDN accepts the request, it creates a new Trigger Resource and returns its unique URI to uCDN.
		uCDN MUST use this URI for all requests associated with the created Trigger Resource.
	</t>
	<t>	uCDN can only access Trigger Resources it created. </t>
   	<t> 
		Note that the version of the Trigger Resources that uCDN requests to create MUST match the version 
		of CI/T Trigger objects reported as supported by dCDN. 
   	</t>

	<t>	The CI/T interface supports the following types of trigger action::</t>

	<t>
		<list style="symbols">
		<t>preposition - used to instruct dCDN to fetch metadata from the uCDN or content from any origin including uCDN.</t>
   		<t>invalidate - used to instruct dCDN to revalidate specific metadata or content before reusing it.</t>
		<t>purge - used to instruct dCDN to delete specific metadata or content.</t>
   		</list>
	</t>
	<t>Note that additional action types can be defined and registered in the future. </t>

	<t>
		The trigger resource has a state attribute.  
		dCDN creates new triggers in "pending" state. Once dCDN starts processing a trigger, the trigger 
		state is set to "active". 
		Once the the trigger processing is complete, the state is set to either "complete" or "failed", 
		depending on the processing outcome.
	</t>
	<t>
		uCDN MAY request dCDN to cancel a trigger. If such request is accepted, the trigger state is changed to 
		"cancelling", and when the cancellation is complete, the trigger state changes to "cancelled".
	</t>	
	<t> 	
		For full description of the Trigger Resource, please refer to <xref target="trigger-specification"/>.
	</t>

   </section>
   <section title="Trigger Collection Resource" anchor="model-for-cdni-triggers-trigger-collection-resource">
	<t>
		Trigger Collection is a resource that represents one or more trigger resources, belonging to particular uCDN.
		dCDN maintains one Trigger Collection resource for each uCDN. 
		Each uCDN only has access to its own collection resource.

		dCDN supports retrieval of multiple representation of the trigger collection resource.
		The supported trigger collection representations are listed in 
		<xref target="collections-of-trigger-status-resources"/>, and include filtering of Trigger Resourcs by
		Trigger State and Trigger Label attributes.
		Note that additional trigger collection representations can be defined and registered in the future.

   <section title="Session Overview" anchor="model-for-cdni-triggers-session-overview">

   	<t>
	   	Figure 1 is an example showing the basic message flow in a CI/T interface session used by the
		uCDN to trigger activity in dCDN and for uCDN to discover the status of that activity. 
		Only successful triggering is shown.
		Examples of the messages are shown in <xref target="examples"/>.

   <t> 	The steps in Figure 1 are as follows:</t>

   <t>
   <list style="numbers">
	<t>	
		uCDN requests to create a new Trigger Resource by POSTing its representation to
		the trigger collection resource with a well-known URI "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/uCDN". 
       .</t>
   	<t>
		dCDN authenticates the request, validates the Trigger Resource in it, and if the request is accepted,
		creates a new Trigger Resource.
	</t>
	<t>
		dCDN responds to uCDN with an HTTP 201 response status and the location of the Trigger Resource.
	</t>

	<t>
		uCDN MAY query, possibly repeatedly, the Trigger Resource in dCDN.
	</t>

	<t>
		dCDN responds to each query with the current Trigger Resource representation, including the trigger state, 
		that reflects the progress of the uCDN request.
	</t>
	<t>
		Once the trigger reaches a terminal state ("complete", "failed" or "cancelled"), uCDN MAY request to delete
		Trigger Resource. 
	</t>
	<t>
		dCDN validates the request and the Trigger Resource state. If successful, the Trigger Status is removed by the server,
		and subsequent requests for this resource MUST result in 404 (Not Found).
	</t>
	<t>
		dCDN responds to the delettion request with 200 (OK) status code.
	</t>
   </list>
   </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Timing and Order of Trigger Processing" anchor="timig-of-trigger-processing">
   <t>
   	uCDN MAY place limits on timing and order of execution of a trigger through optional 
	<xref target="time-policy">TimePolicy</xref> and/or <xref target="execution-policy">Execution Policy</xref> extensions. 
	If neither of these extensions are present in the trigger resource, the timing and order 
	of the trigger execution of CI/T Commands is under dCDN's control, including start time, pacing 
	of the activity in the network and order in which dCDN chooses to process pending triggers.
   </t>	
   <t>
	The CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" trigger actions MUST be applied to all data acquired before dCDN begins the trigger 
	processing (i.e. enters "active" state).. 
	dCDN SHOULD NOT apply CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" actions to data acquired after the trigger processing started, 
	but this may not always be achievable, so uCDN cannot count on that.
   </t>

   <t>
	If uCDN wishes to invalidate or purge content and then immediately pre-position replacement content at the same URLs, 
	it SHOULD ensure that dCDN has completed the invalidate/purge before initiating the pre-positioning. 
	Otherwise, there is a risk that the dCDN pre-positions the new content, then immediately invalidates or
	purges it (as a result of the two uCDN requests running in parallel).
	
	uCDN MAY use the <xref target="execution-policy">Execution Policy</xref> extension to condition the start of pre-position 
	trigger processing on completion of the earlier invalidate/purge trigger(s).
   </t>

   <t>
	dCDN implementation can choose whether to apply "invalidate" and "purge" triggers to content acquisition that has 
	already started when the trigger becomes active.
   </t>

   </section>

   <section title="Scope of Trigger Processing" anchor="scope-of-trigger-processing">
  	<t>
   		Each trigger can operate on multiple metadata and content elements, 
   		usually referred to by their URLs. These elements are targeted by specifying
   		both their subject (i.e., "metadata" or "content") as well as specification 
   		method (e.g., URL Regexes) and value.
   	</t>

   	<t>
   		Multiple representations of an HTTP resource may share the same URL.
		Triggers that invalidate or purge metadata or content apply to all resource representations with matching URLs.
	</t>

	<section title="Multiple Interconnected CDNs" anchor="multiple-interconnected-cdns">
	<t>
   		In a network of interconnected CDNs, a single uCDN will originate a
   		given item of metadata and associated content. It would possibly distribute
   		that metadata and content to more than one dCDN, which in turn
   		distributes that metadata and content to additional CDNs located further
		downstream.
	</t>

   	<t>
   		An intermediate CDN is dCDN that passes on CDNI Metadata and
		content to dCDNs located further downstream.
	</t>

   	<t>
   		A "diamond" configuration is one where dCDN can acquire metadata
   		and content originated in one uCDN from that uCDN itself and an
		intermediate CDN, or via more than one intermediate CDN.
	</t>

   	<t>
   		Triggers originating in the single source uCDN affect metadata
   		and content in all dCDNs; however, in a diamond configuration, it may
		not be possible for dCDN to determine from which uCDN it acquired content. 
		In this case, dCDN MUST allow each uCDN from which it may have acquired the content 
		to act upon that content using triggers.
	</t>

   	<t>
   		In all other cases, dCDN MUST reject triggers from uCDN that
   		attempts to act on another uCDN's content by using, for example,
		responding with an HTTP 403 ("Forbidden").
	</t>

   	<t> 	Security considerations are discussed further in <xref target="security-considerations"/>.</t>
   	<t>
   `		The diamond configuration may lead to inefficient interactions, but
		the interactions are otherwise harmless. For example:
	</t>

	<t><list style="symbols">
			<t>When uCDN request to create an "invalidate" trigger, dCDN will
			receive that request from multiple directly connected uCDNs. The
			dCDN may schedule multiple such triggers separately, and the last
			scheduled trigger may affect content already revalidated following
			execution of the "invalidate" trigger that was scheduled first.</t>

			<t>If one of dCDN's directly connected uCDNs loses its rights to
			distribute content, it may issue a "purge" trigger. That

			can be reacquired by dCDN from the remaining uCDN.</t>

   			<t>When uCDN originating an item of content issues a purge
			followed by a pre-position, two directly connected uCDNs will pass
			those triggers to dCDN. That dCDN implementation need not merge
			those operations or notice the repetition, in which case the purge
			issued by one uCDN will be completed before the other. The first uCDN
			to finish its purge may then forward the "preposition" trigger,
			and content pre-positioned as a result might be affected by the
			still-running purge issued by the other uCDN. However, dCDN
			will reacquire that content as needed, or when it's asked to
			pre-position the content by the second uCDN. dCDN
			implementation could avoid this interaction by knowing which uCDN
			it acquired the content from, or it could minimize the
			consequences by recording the time at which the
			"invalidate"/"purge" trigger was received and not applying it to
			content acquired after that time.</t>

   <t>
   The CI/T Trigger Command MUST NOT be reported as "complete" until all

   and URLs or patterns affected, SHOULD be enumerated in the Trigger
   Status Resource. For more details, see <xref target="error-handling"/>.</t>

   <t>
   If dCDN is also acting as uCDN in a cascade, it MUST forward CI/T
   Commands to any dCDNs that may be affected. The CI/T Trigger Command
   MUST NOT be reported as "complete" in a CDN until it is "complete" in
   all of its dCDNs. If a CI/T Trigger Command is reported as
   "processed" in any dCDN, intermediate CDNs MUST NOT report
   "complete"; instead, they MUST also report "processed". A CI/T
   Command MAY be reported as "failed" as soon as it fails in a CDN or
   any of its dCDNs. A cancelled CI/T Trigger Command MUST be
   reported as "cancelling" until it has been reported as "cancelled",
   "complete", or "failed" by all dCDNs in a cascade.</t>

   <section title="Collections of Trigger Status Resources" anchor="collections-of-trigger-status-resources"><t>
   As described in <xref target="model-for-cdni-triggers"/>, Trigger Status Resources exist in dCDN
   to report the status of activity triggered by each uCDN.</t>

   <t>
   A collection of Trigger Status Resources is a resource that contains
   a reference to each Trigger Status Resource in that collection.
   Note that the collection may refer to Trigger Status Resources of triggers from several versions of CI/T objects,
   i.e., a subsequent call for the retrieval of the relevant trigger status may provide 
   objects of various MIME media types: ci-trigger-status as defined in <xref target="RFC8007"/>, ci-trigger-status.v2 
   defined in this document, or objects of future CI/T objects versions, based on the CI/T command version used for the creation of the trigger. </t>

   <t>
   dCDN MUST make a collection of uCDN's Trigger Status Resources
   available to that uCDN. This collection includes all of the Trigger
   Status Resources created for CI/T Commands from uCDN that have
   been accepted by dCDN and have not yet been deleted by uCDN
   or expired and removed by dCDN (as described in <xref target="deleting-triggers"/>).
   Trigger Status Resources belonging to uCDN MUST NOT be visible to
   any other CDN. dCDN could, for example, achieve this by offering
   different collection URLs to each uCDN and by filtering the response
   based on uCDN with which the HTTP client is associated.</t>

   <t>
   To trigger an activity in dCDN or to cancel a triggered activity, the
   uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to dCDN's collection of uCDN's
   Trigger Status Resources.</t>

   <t>
   To allow uCDN to check the status of multiple jobs in a
   single request, dCDN MAY also maintain collections representing
   filtered views of the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.
   These filtered collections are "optional-to-implement", but if they
   are implemented, dCDN MUST include links to them in the
   collection of all Trigger Status Resources. 
   </t>


   <section title="Filtered Collections by Trigger Status" anchor="filtered-collections-by-status">
   <t>
   dCDN MAY provide filtered collections per <xref target="trigger-status">Trigger Status</xref>.
   If implemented, dCDN SHOULD provide a separate filtered collection for every Trigger Status, and
   advertise these collections in the collection of all Trigger Resources.
   </t>
   </section>
   <section title="Filtered Collections by Trigger Label" anchor="filtered-collections-by-labels">
   <t>
   dCDN MAY provide filtered collections per <xref target="trigger-label">Trigger Label</xref>, 
   as specified by uCDN in <xref target="trigger-v2-specification"/>.

   </t>
   </section>

   </section>

   <section title="CDNI Trigger Interface" anchor="cdni-trigger-interface"><t>
   This section describes an interface to enable uCDN to trigger
   activity in dCDN.</t>

   <t>
   The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP, so dCDNs may make use of
   any HTTP feature when implementing the CI/T interface. For example,
   dCDN SHOULD make use of HTTP's caching mechanisms to indicate that
   a requested response/representation has not been modified, reducing
   uCDN's processing needed to determine whether the status of
   triggered activity has changed.</t>

   <t>
   dCDNs MAY implement separate CI/T interfaces per <xref target="trigger-subject"/>,
   i.e. one CI/T interface for trigger operations on metadata and another for operations on content.
   In this case, dCDN MUST advertise separate interface endpoints via <xref target="cit-trigger-endpoints-capability-object"/>.

   </t>
   <t>
   All dCDNs implementing CI/T MUST support the HTTP GET, HEAD, POST,
   and DELETE methods as defined in <xref target="RFC9110"/>.</t>

   <t>
   The only representation specified in this document is JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/>.
   It MUST be supported by uCDN and by dCDN.</t>

   <t>
   The URL of dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources
   needs to be either discovered by or configured in uCDN. The
   mechanism for discovery of that URL is outside the scope of this
   document.</t>

   <t>
   CI/T Commands are POSTed to dCDN's collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources. If a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted by dCDN,
   dCDN creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its URI to
   uCDN in an HTTP 201 response. The triggered activity can then be
   monitored by uCDN using that resource and the collections
   described in <xref target="collections-of-trigger-status-resources"/>.</t>

   <t>
   The URI of each Trigger Status Resource is returned to uCDN when
   it is created, and URIs of all Trigger Status Resources are listed in
   dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources. This means
   all Trigger Status Resources can be discovered by uCDN, so dCDNs
   are free to assign whatever structure they desire to the URIs for
   CI/T resources. Therefore, uCDNs MUST NOT make any assumptions
   regarding the structure of CI/T URIs or the mapping between CI/T
   objects and their associated URIs. The URIs used in the examples in
   this document are purely illustrative and are not intended to impose
   a definitive structure on CI/T interface implementations.</t>

   <section title="Creating Triggers" anchor="creating-triggers"><t>
   To issue a CI/T Command, uCDN makes an HTTP POST to dCDN's
   collection of all of uCDN's Trigger Status Resources. The
   request body of that POST is a CI/T Command, as described in
   <xref target="cit-trigger-create-command"/>.</t>

   <t>
   dCDN validates the CI/T Command. If the command is malformed or
   uCDN does not have sufficient access rights, dCDN MUST either
   respond with an appropriate 4xx HTTP error code and not create a
   Trigger Status Resource or create a "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   containing an appropriate Error.v2 Description.</t>

   <t>
   When a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted, dCDN MUST create a new
   Trigger Status Resource that will convey a specification of the CI/T
   Command and its current status. The HTTP response to uCDN MUST
   have status code 201 and MUST convey the URI of the Trigger Status
   Resource in the Location header field <xref target="RFC9110"/>. The HTTP response
   SHOULD include the content of the newly created Trigger Status
   Resource. This is particularly important in cases where the CI/T
   Trigger Command has been completed immediately.</t>

   <t>
   Once a Trigger Status Resource has been created, dCDN MUST NOT
   reuse its URI, even after that Trigger Status Resource has been
   removed.</t>

   <t>
   dCDN SHOULD track and report on the progress of CI/T Trigger
   Commands using a Trigger Status Resource (<xref target="trigger-status-resources"/>). If the
   dCDN is not able to do that, it MUST indicate that it has accepted
   the request but will not be providing further status updates. To do
   this, it sets the status of the Trigger Status Resource to
   "processed". In this case, CI/T processing should continue as for a
   "complete" request, so the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to
   dCDN's collection of complete Trigger Status Resources. dCDN
   SHOULD also provide an estimated completion time for the request by
   using the "etime" property of the Trigger Status Resource. This will
   allow uCDN to schedule pre-positioning after an earlier delete of
   the same URLs is expected to have finished.</t>

   <t>
   If dCDN can track the execution of CI/T Commands and a
   CI/T Command is queued by dCDN for later action, the "status"
   property of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "pending". Once
   processing has started, the status MUST be "active". Finally, once
   the CI/T Command is complete, the status MUST be set to "complete" or
   "failed".</t>

   <t>
   A CI/T Trigger Command may result in no activity in dCDN if, for
   example, it is an "invalidate" or "purge" request for datdCDN
   has not yet acquired, or a "preposition" request for data that it has
   already acquired and that is still valid. In this case, the status
   of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "processed" or "complete", and
   the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to dCDN's collection of
   complete Trigger Status Resources.</t>

   <t>
   Once created, Trigger Status Resources can be cancelled or deleted by
   uCDN, but not modified. dCDN MUST reject PUT and POST
   requests from uCDN to Trigger Status Resources by responding with
   an appropriate HTTP status code -- for example, 405 ("Method Not Allowed").</t>

   </section>

   <section title="Modifying Triggers" anchor="modifying-triggers">
   <t>
      uCDN can request modification of an existing Trigger Command by issuing 
   CI/T Modify Trigger Command. Allowed modifications include an update of the 
   Trigger Command specification and change of state. 
   </t>
   <t>
   dCDN MAY accept the request to update specification when the trigger has
   "pending" status, i.e. the trigger has not been acted upon yet. 
   </t>
   <t>
   dCDN MAY accept the trigger status change request as long as:
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>the requested state is "cancelled"</t>
      <t>the trigger has either "pending" or "active" status before the request</t>
      </list>
   </t>

   <t>
   Modification of existing triggers is useful for uCDN to correct an error 
   in trigger specification or trigger extension(s) that may govern when 
   the Trigger Command is to be executed.
   </t>

   <t>
   dCDN MUST respond to the CI/T Modify Trigger Command appropriately.
   For example, HTTP status code 200 ("OK") should be returned if the 
   modification has been processed, 202 ("Accepted") if the command has been 
   accepted but the modification is not fully complete yet, 404 ("Not Found") 
   when the Trigger Status Resource does not exist, 409 ("Conflict") when the 
   Trigger Status Resource is in a state that doesn't allow the requested modification, 
   501 ("Not Implemented") if modification is not supported by dCDN or 
   an appropriate 4xx HTTP error code in case of a malformed request.
   </t>

   </section>
   
   <section title="Checking Status" anchor="checking-status"><t>
   uCDN has two ways to check the progress of CI/T Commands it has
   issued to dCDN, as described in Sections <xref target="polling-collections"/> and 
   <xref target="polling-trigger-resources"/>.</t>

   <t>
   To allow uCDN to check for changes in the status of a Trigger
   Status Resource or collection of Trigger Status Resources without
   refetching the whole resource or collection, dCDN SHOULD include
   entity-tags (ETags) for uCDN to use as cache validators, as
   defined in <xref target="RFC9110"/>.</t>

   <t>
   dCDN SHOULD use the cache control headers for responses to GETs
   for Trigger Status Resources and Collections to indicate the
   frequency at which it recommends that uCDN should poll for
   change.</t>

   <section title="Polling Trigger Status Resource Collections" anchor="polling-collections">
   <t>
   uCDN can fetch the collection of its Trigger Status Resources or
   filtered views of that collection.
   </t>

   <t>
   This makes it possible to poll the status of all CI/T Trigger
   Commands in a single request. If dCDN moves a Trigger Status
   Resource from the active to the completed collection, uCDN can
   fetch the result of that activity.</t>

   <t>
   When polling in this way, uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the whole collection. An
   example of this is given in <xref target="examples-polling-status-changes"/>.</t>

      <section title="Extended View Trigger Status Resource Collections" anchor="polling-collections-extended">
   <t>
      If dCDN advertises support for extended status, uCDN MAY request the extended Trigger Collection,
      which embeds all Trigger Status resources in the collection itself, 
      in addition to a list of Trigger Status resource URLs. This support includes all types of 
         Trigger Status Resources Collections, including filtered collections.
   </t>   
   <t>
      uCDN SHOULD request the extended Trigger Collection view by passing the query string parameter 
      "status=extended" when requesting a Trigger Status Resource Collection.
      dCDN SHOULD appropriately respond to the request for extended status with HTTP Status 200 ("OK") 
      when such request can be satisfied, with error code 501 ("Not Implemented") if the capability 
      has not been implemented or advertised, and 400 ("Bad Request") in case of an unrecognized query parameters.
   </t>
   </section>
   </section>

   <section title="Polling Trigger Status Resources" anchor="polling-trigger-resources"><t>
   uCDN has a URI provided by dCDN for each Trigger Status
   Resource it has created. It may fetch that Trigger Status Resource
   at any time.</t>

   <t>
   This can be used to retrieve progress information and to fetch the
   result of the CI/T Command.</t>

   <t>
   When polling in this way, uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the Trigger Status
   Resource.</t>

   </section>

   </section>

   <section title="Cancelling Triggers" anchor="cancelling-triggers">
   <t>
   uCDN can request cancellation of a trigger by issuing CI/T Modify 
   Trigger Command to the specific trigger's Trigger Status Resource URL 
   and setting the "desired-status" field to "cancelled".
   </t>

   <t>
   dCDN is required to accept and respond to the CI/T Modify
   Command, but the actual cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command is
   optional-to-implement.</t>

   <t>
   dCDN MUST respond to the CI/T Modify Command appropriately -- for
   example, with HTTP status code 200 ("OK") if the cancellation has
   been processed and the CI/T Command is inactive, 202 ("Accepted") if
   the command has been accepted but the CI/T Command remains active, 404 ("Not Found") 
   when the Trigger Status Resource does not exist, or
   501 ("Not Implemented") if cancellation is not supported by dCDN.</t>

   <t>
   If cancellation of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is accepted by
   dCDN, dCDN SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity.
   Requesting a cancellation of a trigger using a CI/T Modify Command for a "pending" 
   Trigger Status Resource does not, however, guarantee that the corresponding activity will not
   be started, because uCDN cannot control the timing of that
   activity. Processing could, for example, start after the POST is
   sent by uCDN but before that request is processed by dCDN.</t>

   <t>
   If cancellation of an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource
   is accepted by dCDN, dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T
   Command. However, as with the cancellation of a "pending" CI/T Command,
   dCDN does not guarantee this.</t>

   <t>
   If the CI/T Command cannot be stopped immediately, the status in the
   corresponding Trigger Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelling",
   and the Trigger Status Resource MUST remain in the collection of
   Trigger Status Resources for active CI/T Commands. If processing is
   stopped before normal completion, the status value in the Trigger
   Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelled", and the Trigger Status
   Resource MUST be included in the collection of failed CI/T Trigger
   Commands.</t>

   <t>
   Cancellation of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   requires no processing in dCDN. Its status MUST NOT be changed
   to "cancelled".</t>

   </section>

   <section title="Deleting Triggers" anchor="deleting-triggers"><t>
   uCDN can delete Trigger Status Resources at any time using the
   HTTP DELETE method. As defined in the CDNI Control Interface / Triggers 1st edition <xref target="RFC8007"/>,
   the effect is similar to cancellation, but no
   Trigger Status Resource remains afterwards. Note that in cases where the 
   trigger's status before the deletion is not a terminal status (i.e., "completed", "failed"
   or "cancelled"), uCDN would not have the ability to further monitor the 
   cancellation process and the final status of the trigger. 
   For this reason, it is recommended that the trigger is cancelled (see <xref target="cancelling-triggers"/>) 
   before trigger deletion and deletion is only used on triggers with a terminal status.</t>

   <t>
   Once deleted, the references to a Trigger Status Resource MUST be
   removed from all Trigger Status Resource collections. Subsequent
   requests to GET the deleted Trigger Status Resource SHOULD be
   rejected by dCDN with an HTTP error.</t>

   <t>
   If a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, dCDN
   SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity. Deleting a
   "pending" Trigger Status Resource does not, however, guarantee that
   it has not started, because uCDN cannot control the timing of
   that activity. Processing may, for example, start after the DELETE
   is sent by uCDN but before that request is processed by dCDN.</t>

   <t>
   If an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the
   dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T Command. However, as with
   deletion of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource, dCDN does not
   guarantee this.</t>

   <t>
   Deletion of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource requires
   no processing in dCDN other than deletion of the Trigger Status
   Resource.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="Expiry of Trigger Status Resources" anchor="expiry-of-trigger-status-resourcs"><t>
   dCDN can choose to automatically delete Trigger Status Resources

   "cancelled". In this case, dCDN will remove the Trigger Status
   Resource and respond to subsequent requests for it with an HTTP
   error.</t>

   <t>
   If dCDN does remove Trigger Status Resources automatically, it
   MUST report the length of time after which it will do so, using a
   property of the collection of all Trigger Status Resources. It is
   RECOMMENDED that Trigger Status Resources are not automatically
   deleted by dCDN for at least 24 hours after they become
   "complete", "processed", "failed", or "cancelled".</t>

   <t>
   To ensure that it can get the status of its Trigger Status
   Resources for completed and failed CI/T Commands, it is RECOMMENDED
   that uCDN polling interval is less than the time after which
   records for completed activity will be deleted.</t>

   <section title="Loop Detection and Prevention" anchor="loop-detection-and-prevention"><t>
   Given three CDNs, A, B, and C, if CDNs B and C delegate delivery of
   CDN A's content to each other, CDN A's CI/T Commands could be passed
   between CDNs B and C in a loop. More complex networks of CDNs could
   contain similar loops involving more hops.</t>

   <t>
   To prevent and detect such CI/T loops, each CDN uses a CDN
   Provider ID (PID) to uniquely identify itself. In every CI/T Command
   it originates or cascades, each CDN MUST append an array element
   containing its CDN PID to a JSON array under an entry named
   "cdn-path". When receiving CI/T Commands, dCDN MUST check the
   cdn-path and reject any CI/T Command that already contains its own
   CDN PID in the cdn-path. Transit CDNs MUST check the cdn-path and
   not cascade the CI/T Command to dCDNs that are already listed in the
   cdn-path.</t>

   <t>
   The CDN PID consists of the two characters "AS" followed by the CDN
   provider's Autonomous System number <xref target="RFC1930"/>, then a colon (":") and
   an additional qualifier that is used to guarantee uniqueness in case
   a particular AS has multiple independent CDNs deployed -- for
   example, "AS64496:0".</t>

   <t>
   If the CDN provider has multiple ASes, the same AS number SHOULD be
   used in all messages from that CDN provider, unless there are
   multiple distinct CDNs.</t>

   <t>
   If the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI) described in
   <xref target="RFC7975"/> is implemented by dCDN, the CI/T interface and the RI
   SHOULD use the same CDN PID.</t>

   </section>
        
   <section title="Error Handling" anchor="error-handling"><t>
   dCDN can signal rejection of a CI/T Command using HTTP status codes
   -- for example, 400 ("Bad Request") if the request is malformed, or
   403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found") if uCDN does not have
   permission to issue CI/T Commands or it is trying to act on another
   CDN's data.</t>

   <t>
   If any part of the CI/T Trigger Command fails, the trigger SHOULD be
   reported as "failed" once its activity is complete or if no further
   errors will be reported. The "errors" property in the Trigger Status
   Resource will be used to enumerate which actions failed and the
   reasons for failure, and can be present while the Trigger Status
   Resource is still "pending" or "active" if the CI/T Trigger Command
   is still running for some URLs or patterns in the Trigger
   Specification.</t>

   <t>
   Once a request has been accepted, processing errors are reported in
   the Trigger Status Resource using a list of Error.v2 Descriptions. Each
   Error.v2 Description is used to report errors against one or more of the
   URLs or patterns in the Trigger Specification.</t>

   <t>
   If a Surrogate affected by a CI/T Trigger Command is offline in the
   dCDN or dCDN is unable to pass a CI/T Command on to any of its
   cascaded dCDNs:</t>

   <t><list style="symbols"><t>If the CI/T Command is abandoned by dCDN, dCDN SHOULD
      report an error.</t>

   <t>A CI/T "invalidate" command may be reported as "complete" when
      Surrogates that may have the data are offline. In this case,
      Surrogates MUST NOT use the affected data without first
      revalidating it when they are back online.</t>

   <t>CI/T "preposition" and "purge" commands can be reported as
      "processed" if affected caches are offline and the activity will
      complete when they return to service.</t>

   <t>Otherwise, dCDN SHOULD keep the Trigger Status Resource in
      state "pending" or "active" until either the CI/T Command is acted
      upon or uCDN chooses to cancel it.</t>

        <section anchor="error-propagation" title="Error propagation">
          <t>
             This subsection explains the mechanism for enabling uCDN to trace an error back to dCDN in which it occurred.
             CDNI triggers may be propagated over a chain of downstream CDNs. For example, an 
             upstream CDN A (uCDN-A) that is delegating to a downstream CDN B (dCDN-B) and dCDN-B is delegating 
             to a downstream CDN C (dCDN-C). Triggers sent from uCDN-A to dCDN-B may be redistributed 
             from dCDN-B to dCDN-C, and errors can occur anywhere along the path. Therefore, it might be essential for 
             uCDN-A that sets the trigger, to be able to trace back an error to the downstream CDN where it occurred. 
             This document adds a mechanism to propagate the PID of dCDN where the fault occurred, back to the 
             uCDN by adding the PID
             to the error.v2 description. When dCDN-B propagates a trigger further to the downstream dCDN-C, 
             it MUST also propagate back the errors received in the trigger status resource from dCDN-C by adding
             them to the errors array in its own status resource to be sent back to the originating uCDN-A.
             While propagating back the errors dCDN-B MAY also 
             specify dCDN-C PID, indicating to which CDN the error specifically relates.
             The trigger originating upstream CDN then receives an array built of the errors that occurred 
             in all the CDNs along the execution path, where each error MAY carry its own CDN identifier.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="error-propagation-seq"/> below is an example showing the message flow used by
            uCDN-A to trigger activity in dCDN-B, followed by dCDN-C, as well as the discovery of the
            status of that activity, including the Error Propagation.

          <t>
            A "trigger.v2" object, as defined in <xref target="trigger-v2-specification"/> includes an
            optional array of trigger extension objects. A trigger extension contains properties
            that are used as directives for dCDN when executing the trigger command, e.g., 
            location policies, time policies, and so on. Each such CDNI Trigger extension is a specialization
            of a CDNI GenericTriggerExtension object. The GenericTriggerExtension object abstracts the basic
            information required for trigger distribution from the specifics of any given property
            (i.e., property semantics, enforcement options, etc.). All trigger extensions are optional,
            and it is thus the responsibility of the extension specification to define a consistent default
            behavior for extensions supported by dCDN when not specified by uCDN.
          </t>

          <section anchor="enforcement-options" title="Enforcement Options">
           <t>
             The trigger enforcement options concept is in accordance with the metadata enforcement options
             as defined in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8006"/>.
           </t>
           <t>
             The GenericTriggerExtension object defines the properties contained within it
             as well as whether or not the properties are "mandatory-to-enforce".
             If dCDN does not understand or support a mandatory-to-enforce
             property, dCDN MUST NOT execute the trigger command. If the extension is
             not mandatory-to-enforce, then that GenericTriggerExtension object can be
             safely ignored and the trigger command can be processed in accordance
             with the rest of the CDNI Trigger spec.
           </t>
           <t>
             Although a CDN MUST NOT execute a trigger command if a
             mandatory-to-enforce extension cannot be enforced, it could still be
             safe to redistribute that trigger (the "safe-to-redistribute"
             property) to another CDN without modification. For example, in the
             cascaded CDN case, a transit CDN (tCDN) could convey
             mandatory-to-enforce trigger extension to dCDN. For a trigger extension
             that does not require customization or translation (i.e., trigger extension
             that is safe-to-redistribute), the data representation received off the wire
             MAY be stored and redistributed without being understood or supported
             by tCDN. However, for trigger extension that requires translation,
             transparent redistribution of uCDN trigger values might not be
             appropriate. Certain trigger extensions can be safely, though perhaps not
             optimally, redistributed unmodified. For example, pre-position command might
             be executed in suboptimal times for some geographies if transparently
             redistributed, but it might still work.
           </t>
           <t>
             Redistribution safety MUST be specified for each GenericTriggerExtension
             listed. If a CDN does not understand or support a given
             GenericTriggerExtension object that is not safe-to-redistribute, the CDN
             MUST set the "incomprehensible" flag to true for that GenericTriggerExtension
             object before redistributing it. The "incomprehensible"
             flag signals to dCDN that trigger metadata was not properly transformed
             by the tCDN. A CDN MUST NOT attempt to execute a trigger with an extension that has been
             marked as "incomprehensible" by uCDN.
           </t>
           <t>
             tCDNs MUST NOT change the value of mandatory-to-enforce or
             safe-to-redistribute when propagating a trigger to dCDN. Although a
             tCDN can set the value of "incomprehensible" to true, a tCDN MUST NOT
             change the value of "incomprehensible" from true to false.

   </texttable>
   
   <t>
   Along with the Trigger Status, the Trigger Status Resource object includes a Status Reason property,
   allowing dCDN to provide additional information for the trigger status.
   For example, dCDN may indicate that the trigger status is "pending" due to one of the execution prerequisites not
   being fulfilled. Such a prerequisite may be specified via one of the extensions.</t>

   <section title="Error Code" anchor="error-code"><t>
   This type is used by dCDN to report failures in trigger
   processing. All Error Codes MUST be registered in the IANA "CDNI CI/T Error Codes" registry (see <xref target="cdni-cit-error-code-registry"/>). Unknown Error Codes
   MUST be treated as fatal errors, and the request MUST NOT be
   automatically retried without modification.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="URL Type" anchor="url-types">
   <t>
   This type is used by uCDN to indicate how to interpret URLs referenced by trigger specs that use URLs, such as 
      <xref target="urls-spec"/>, <xref target="uri-pattern-match-spec"/>, <xref target="uri-regex-match-spec"/> and <xref target="objectlist-spec"/>.
   </t>
   <t>
   One option for uCDN to use in Trigger Commands is published URLs, which are used by end users.
   When using this URL type, uCDN MUST provide configuration metadata objects related to these URLs before creating a trigger option referencing these URLs. When this is not the case, dCDN MUST return the error code "emeta".
   </t>
   <t> 
      When processing published URLs in "preposition" Trigger Action, dCDN MUST invoke processing of metadata objects it would have invoked in content acquisition to satisfy an end-user request, e.g. SourceMetadata (see Section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC8006"/>).
   </t>

   <t>
      Another type of URL in common use is a private URL, which is based on cache keys that are dynamically 
      constructed via lightweight processing of various properties of the HTTP request and/or response. 
      As an example, an origin might specify a cache key as a value returned in a specific HTTP response header.
   </t>
   <t>
      As an example, uCDN may prefer to use such private URLs in "purge" or "invalidate" 
      Trigger Actions to simplify processing. 
   </t>
   <t>   dCDNs implementing the CI/T Interface MUST support the "published" URL type.
      dCDN MAY support the additional "private" URL type. In this case, dCDN SHOULD advertise the private URL type support
      via FCI using <xref target="private-url-capability-object"/>.
      If the private URL is not supported by dCDN, it SHOULD reject the Trigger Command using "eunsupported" Error Code.
      If both URL types are supported by dCDN, uCDN MUST use only one URL type in each Trigger Command.
   </t>
   <t>
      The following URL types are defined by this document and MUST be supported by the implementation 
      of the CI/T interface:

   <section title="ObjectList" anchor="object-list">
   <t>
   ObjectList is a metadata object describing lists of objects that can be used in the context of CI/T v2 trigger spec, trigger status resources and other contexts as required. The ObjectList object can either embed the lists of objects or point to external URL(s) that hold such lists. ObjectList allows the specification of an object list type, providing instructions on the interpretation of the object list format.
   </t>

   <t>
   ObjectLists MAY be recursive, i.e. including references to secondary manifests, including references to HLS, MPEG-DASH or MSS manifests as well as additional JSON-encoded ObjectLists, etc. The party consuming the object list MUST parse all recursions based on the object list type property. When doing so, the consuming party should also detect potential loops when the descendant ObjectList points back to the parent ObjectList.
   </t>

   <t>
   In the case of uCDN accessing ObjectList objects referencing external URLs published by dCDN, both parties should comply with the CI/T interface security requirements (see <xref target="authentication-authorization"/> for details). 
   When dCDN accesses external URLs referenced by ObjectLists supplied by uCDN, for example as part of Trigger Spec, dCDN MUST match these URLs with source metadata objects, published by uCDN, such as SourceMetadata objects specified in Section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC8006"/>, and use these metadata objects for content acquisition if a match was found.
   </t>

   <t>
ObjectLists MAY combine regular objects and secondary ObjectLists in the same object.
      Please note that when embedding non-JSON object lists directly in ObjectList, absolute URLs MUST be provided at all times and the text SHOULD be encoded in accordance with the JSON grammar specification <xref target="ECMA404"/>, including explicit newline encoding. When uCDN accesses ObjectList metadata resources published by uCDN, the same interface authentication and authorization requirements would apply, as when accessing the interface itself.
   </t>

           If two or more footprints overlap, the first footprint that matches against the cache's location
           determines the action a CDN MUST take. If the "locations" property is an empty list or if none of
           the listed footprints match the location of a specific cache location, then the result is equivalent
           to a "deny" action.

        <t>uCDN may wish to perform content management operations on dCDN on a specific schedule.
           The TimePolicy extension allows uCDN to instruct dCDN to execute the trigger command
           in a desired time window. For example, a content provider that wishes to pre-populate a new
           episode at off-peak time so that it would be ready on caches at prime time when the episode
           is released for viewing. A scheduled operation enables uCDN to direct dCDN in what
           time frame to execute the trigger.
        </t>
        <t>
           uCDN may wish to schedule a trigger such that dCDN will execute it in local time,
           as it is measured in each region. For example, uCDN may wish dCDN to pull the content
           at off-peak hours, between 2AM-4AM, however, as a CDN is distributed across multiple time
           zones, the UTC definition of 2AM depends on the actual location.
        </t>
        <t>We define two alternatives for localized scheduling:<list style="symbols">
           <t>Regional schedule: When used in conjunction with the Location Policy defined
              in <xref target="location-policy"/>, uCDN can trigger separate commands for
              different geographical regions, for each region using a different schedule. This allows
              uCDN to control the execution time per region.
           </t>
           <t>Local Time schedule: We introduce a "local time" version for Internet timestamps
              that follows the notation for local time as defined in Section 4.2.2 of <xref target="ISO8601"/>.
              When local time is used, that dCDN SHOULD execute the triggers at different absolute times,
              according to the local time of each execution location.

   <t>
      Unless specified otherwise, dCDN is at liberty to decide how to choose trigger commands for execution from all pending commands, whether to process trigger commands sequentially or in parallel, immediately upon acceptance, or with a delay in batches. uCDN may wish to control trigger processing in more detail, including the order of execution, dependencies, and concurrency.
   </t>
   <t>
   Example use cases:
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>
      Priority:  uCDN may have multiple trigger commands in "pending" and/or "active" mode. For example, trigger commands with policy constraints, a large number of content objects affected, or other dCDN business logic may take a long time to execute.
      uCDN may wish to prescribe the order in which dCDN picks up its trigger commands for execution from the "pending" queue, by indicating a relative priority of each trigger. The priority would affect the selection of trigger commands specific to the requesting uCDN. dCDN may separately prioritize triggers from multiple uCDNs subject to its business logic. 

      Multiple priority-related use cases exist: 
         <list style="symbols">
         <t> uCDN needs to introduce an urgent "purge" or "invalidate" trigger into an existing queue of trigger commands to correct wrong versions of content objects published by it</t>
         <t> uCDN needs to indicate which content objects should be prepositioned, purged or invalidated first, for example prepositioning newer released content before prepositioning updates to an existing catalog</t>
         </list>
      </t>

      <t>
      Pre-requisite:  In some cases, uCDN may wish to indicate what trigger commands should be processed and completed before another trigger command is processed. 
      For example, uCDN may want to rectify incorrectly published content by purging content objects and then 
      prepositioning them again. In this case, uCDN may want the preposition trigger command to be processed only 
      after the purge trigger command has been processed because concurrent processing of these triggers may cause 
      the new version of these content objects to be purged. 

      Alternatively, uCDN may wish to condition the execution of purge or invalidation triggers upon the completion 
      or cancellation of long-running preposition triggers to avoid race conditions that would result from processing 
      these in parallel.

      The prerequisite requirement implies that a previous trigger reaches one of the following states:   
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>"complete" or "processed" for successful completion</t>
         <t>"failed" for failed processing</t>
         <t>"cancelled" for completion of cancellation</t>
      </list>


      </t>

      <t>
      Urgency: uCDN may wish to indicate that dCDN should process a trigger command without delay. 
      This requirement is separate and additional to priority, as priority indicates the order in which 
      triggers should be processed, yet does not prescribe how soon each trigger should be executed. 

      dCDN MAY reject such requests for urgent processing using "ereject" error code. 
      This can happen due to dCDN internal business logic (e.g. batch-driven purge and invalidation), 
      or due to dependencies on other triggers that could not be completed by dCDN immediately. 
      In such a case uCDN should either modify the request by removing prerequisites or cancel such pending 
      triggers before re-trying the request.
      </t>


      </list>

   </t>

        <t>
        uCDN may combine multiple options in the same trigger command. dCDN should consider the following when processing such commands:
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>dCDN MUST reject triggers that are dependent on other pending triggers with lower priority to prevent deadlocks.</t>
        <t>When introducing an urgent trigger uCDN SHOULD indicate a priority that is equal to or higher than the highest priority among the pending triggers that belong to the same uCDN. dCDN MUST reject urgent triggers that have lower priority than other pending triggers of the same uCDN.</t>
        <t>dCDN MUST reject an urgent trigger that has pending triggers as its prerequisite. dCDN MAY reject an urgent trigger that has triggers in an "active" or "cancelling" state as its prerequisite, such as when such triggers are deemed to take a long time to complete or cancel.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

   <t>
   When combining ExtensionPolicy with <xref target="time-policy"/>, TimePolicy governs the time window when the trigger can execute, while ExecutionPolicy controls the order of trigger execution within their respective windows. The following error conditions should be considered by dCDN:
   <list style="symbols">
      <t>When a trigger is marked urgent, but its TimePolicy extension doesn't allow immediate processing, it should be rejected by dCDN.</t>
      <t>When a trigger has a TimePolicy extension and is also dependent on another trigger with a TimePolicy extension, that specifies an execution window (directly or via a chain of dependency) that doesn't start until after the depending trigger's execution window ends, such a trigger should be rejected.</t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>
      The ExtensionPolicy extension is encoded as a JSON object containing the following name/value pairs:

   Description: Indicates whether the trigger should be immediately moved to the "active" state upon acceptance. In the absence of this flag, dCDN is at liberty to choose the time for trigger execution, e.g., batch processing.

   The discovery of the CI/T interface is out of scope of this document.

          <t>
              In the following example, a CI/T "preposition" command is using two extensions to control the
              way the trigger is executed. In this example, the receiving dCDN, identified as "AS64500:0",
              does not support the first extension in the extensions array. dCDN "AS64500:0" further
              distributes this trigger to another downstream CDN that is identified as "AS64501:0", which
              does not support the second extension in the extensions array. The error is propagated from
              "AS64501:0" to "AS64500:0" and the errors.v2 array reflects both errors.

   <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security-considerations"><t>
   The CI/T interface provides a mechanism to allow uCDN to generate
   requests into dCDN and to inspect its own CI/T requests and their
   current states. The CI/T interface does not allow access to, or
   modification of, uCDN or dCDN metadata relating to content
   delivery or to the content itself. It can only control the presence
   of that metadata in dCDN, and the processing work and network
   utilization involved in ensuring that presence.</t>

   <t>
   By examining "preposition" requests to dCDN, and correctly
   interpreting content and metadata URLs, an attacker could learn the
   uCDN's or content owner's predictions for future content popularity.
   By examining "invalidate" or "purge" requests, an attacker could
   learn about changes in the content owner's catalog.</t>

   <t>
   By injecting CI/T Commands, an attacker or a misbehaving uCDN would
   generate work in dCDN and uCDN as they process those requests.
   So would a man-in-the-middle attacker modify valid CI/T Commands
   generated by uCDN. In both cases, that would decrease dCDN's
   caching efficiency by causing it to unnecessarily acquire or
   reacquire content metadata and/or content.</t>

   <t>
   dCDN implementation of CI/T MUST restrict the actions of uCDN to
   the data corresponding to that uCDN. Failure to do so would allow
   uCDNs to detrimentally affect each other's efficiency by generating
   unnecessary acquisition or reacquisition load.</t>

   <t>
   An origin that chooses to delegate its delivery to a CDN is trusting
   that CDN to deliver content on its behalf; the interconnection of
   CDNs is an extension of that trust to dCDNs. That trust relationship
   is a commercial arrangement, outside the scope of the CDNI protocols.
   So, while a malicious CDN could deliberately generate load on dCDN
   using the CI/T interface, the protocol does not otherwise attempt to
   address malicious behavior between interconnected CDNs.</t>

   <section title="Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Integrity Protection" anchor="authentication-authorization">
   <t>
   A CI/T implementation MUST support Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   transport for HTTP (HTTPS) as per <xref target="RFC9110"/>.</t>

   <t>
   TLS MUST be used by the server side (dCDN) and the client side (uCDN)
   of the CI/T interface, including the authentication of the remote end,
   unless alternate methods are used to ensure the security of the
   information in the CI/T interface requests and responses (such as
   setting up an IPsec tunnel between the two CDNs or using a physically
   secured internal network between two CDNs that are owned by the same
   corporate entity).</t>

   <t>
   The use of TLS for transport of the CI/T interface allows dCDN
   and uCDN to authenticate each other using the TLS client
   authentication and TLS server authentication.</t>

   <t>
   Once dCDN and uCDN have mutually authenticated each other,
   TLS allows:</t>

   <t><list style="symbols"><t>dCDN and uCDN to authorize each other (to ensure that they
      are receiving CI/T Commands from, or reporting status to, an
      authorized CDN).</t>

   <t>CDNI commands and responses to be transmitted with
      confidentiality.</t>

   <t>Protection of the integrity of CDNI commands and responses.</t>

   </list>
   </t>

   <t>
   When TLS is used, the general TLS usage guidance in <xref target="RFC9325"/> MUST be
   followed.</t>

   <t>
   The mechanisms for access control are dCDN-specific and are not
   standardized as part of this CI/T specification.</t>

   <t>
   HTTP requests that attempt to access or operate on CI/T data
   belonging to another CDN MUST be rejected using, for example,
   HTTP 403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found"). This is intended to
   prevent unauthorized users from generating unnecessary load in dCDNs
   or uCDNs due to revalidation, reacquisition, or unnecessary
   acquisition.</t>

   <t>
   When deploying a network of interconnected CDNs, the possible
   inefficiencies related to the diamond configuration discussed in
   <xref target="multiple-interconnected-cdns"/> should be considered.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="Denial of Service" anchor="denial-of-service"><t>
   This document does not define a specific mechanism to protect against
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the CI/T interface. However, CI/T
   endpoints can be protected against DoS attacks through the use of TLS
   transport and/or via mechanisms outside the scope of the CI/T
   interface, such as firewalling or the use of Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs).</t>

   <t>
   Depending on the implementation, triggered activity may consume
   significant processing and bandwidth in dCDN. A malicious or
   faulty uCDN could use this to generate unnecessary load in dCDN.
   dCDN should consider mechanisms to avoid overload -- for example,
   by rate-limiting acceptance or processing of CI/T Commands, or by
   performing batch processing.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="Privacy" anchor="privacy"><t>
   The CI/T protocol does not carry any information about individual end
   users of a CDN; there are no privacy concerns for end users.</t>

   <t>
   The CI/T protocol does carry information that could be considered
   commercially sensitive by CDN operators and content owners. The use
   of mutually authenticated TLS to establish a secure session for the
   transport of CI/T data, as discussed in <xref target="authentication-authorization"/>, provides
   confidentiality while the CI/T data is in transit and prevents
   parties other than the authorized dCDN from gaining access to that
   data. dCDN MUST ensure that it only exposes CI/T data related to
   uCDN to clients it has authenticated as belonging to that uCDN.</t>
